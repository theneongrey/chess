# What is this about
This project should help to improve my knowledge in different (.net) Frameworks.
The goal is to use a simple ChessLogic implementation to use it for different purposes (e.g. APIs/UIs/CLIs/CICD-Tests)

# What is the current state of the project
- Currently the main logic should be finished (mostly... some edge cases like draw rules aren't implemented yet).
- The BlazorWASM project is in an "ok"-state and will probably not be continued (maybe the scaling issue will be fixed).
- The minimal API is in a "ok"-state and will probably be continued on demand
- The next step is a Maui Client-App which will be connected to the logic via the minimal API

# Exampe deployment
